A dark, blue/lavender/gray/magenta space-y theme for gvim only, sorry. Also has a few extra highlights for Java. Screenshot at http://excelsi.org/telstar.jpg (the background there is not part of the colorscheme, but it does match nicely...)

If you want to use the Java highlighting you'll need Claudio Fleiner's java.vim syntax highlighting from
